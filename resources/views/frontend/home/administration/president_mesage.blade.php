    “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.” These opening words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights express a concept of man which underpins the framework of human rights embodied in the Universal Declaration and the two international covenants of Human Rights. It is a concept which, it derives most directly from Western political traditions, is in harmony with moral and social teachings to be found in many other traditions and patterns of belief. I am delighted to introduce National Human Rights and Crime Control Bureau a leading social organization, working for the protection of Human rights, liberties and social justice for all people at National & International Level and providing legal assistance to the needy and under-privileged of the Indian Union, centers operating for the cause of spreading human rights awareness in order to break the barriers of class, caste, creed, color and religion.
